# Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

## Description
A prototype convolutional neural network (CNN) developed to classify brain MRI images as either tumour or non-tumour. The project uses labelled image data to train and evaluate a binary classification model.

## Technologies Used
- Language: Python
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras
- Dataset: Brain MRI images from Kaggle

## Key Features
- Image preprocessing and data preparation
- CNN model architecture for image classification
- Binary classification (tumour vs non-tumour)
- Model training and evaluation

## Notes
This project was developed as part of an AI coursework assignment to understand the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks and image classification.
